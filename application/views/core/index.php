		iPals Mentor Program
	</h2>
	<h4>
		August 29th, 2011
	</h4>
	<p>
		Hello ladies,
		<br /><br />
		As the Freshman Initiatives coordinator, I would like to invite you
		all to participate in the iPal mentor program. You remember what it
		was like to be new to UTCS and how intimidating it can be, so here is
		your change to help a freshmen or transfer student adjust to life in
		computer science!
		<br /><br />
		The program will largely revolve around Mentor-Mentee coffee dates,
		unofficial iPals dinners, and a few iPals social events that I have
		yet to plan.  And--of course--whatever you and your mentor want to add
		to the program.
		<br /><br />
		If you are interested, please <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dDVHcmIxZW1vVThsenNQM3N1a2UyZmc6MQ">fill out this form</a> before September 10
		so that I can start matching Mentor-Mentee groups.  (If you miss the
		deadline, but still want to participate, feel free to shoot me an
		email. I just have a lot of work ahead of me and I need your most
		up-to-date contact information.)
		<br /><br />
		We already have several young ladies excited to be part of the program
		so please sign up to help!
		<br /><br />
		Thanks,<br />
		Lisa Lippe<br />

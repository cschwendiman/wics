                <p>As we have had trouble keeping track of our members, we are totally revamping the mailing list and associated information. To remain on the mailing list (or to maintain membership) you must update your information by the first class day of the spring semester, <b>Tuesday, January 18th</b>.</p>
                <p>To update your information, please fill out <a href="https://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?formkey=dG40RXU0OGRGc01ZeGlWY1R2cDdSSGc6MQ">this Google form</a>.</p>
                <p>If you are not a current student or staff member of the university, you may still use the form to stay subscribed to our mailing list.</p>
                <p>We hope to continue offering our members great events and opportunities, but to do so we need to be a little more organized. We appreciate your help in our efforts.</p>

                <p>Hi all,</p>

                <p>We also wanted to plan a flash mob of sorts... performing the Thriller Dance.&nbsp;&nbsp;So, if you are interested in being part of the Thriller dance group, we're going to have practice this Sunday from 1-3 p.m. in Gregory Gym in the Aerobics South room.</p>
                <p>I hope you can make it &mdash; feel free to bring a friend (doesn't have to be a CS major).</p>

                <p>Women in Computer Science,</p>
                <p>I am with Chocbite, a startup chocolate manufacturing company looking for some help restructuring our website. There are minor adjustments to be made, and we are looking for someone with basic website design skills who is looking to refine their skills and have some private sector work to put on their resume. The website is html based, and the updates could easily be done within a week by somebody with moderate html skills.</p>
                <p>You can check out the site. Give my email to whoever would be interested and let them know to email me ASAP for more precise directions.</p>

            <h2 class="title">Upcoming Events: early September</h2>
			<div class="entry">
                <p>Hey all,</p>
                <p>Hope your classes have been going well so far.  Thanks to all of you that attended the kickoff.  We have a few events happening in the next couple weeks I'd like you to be aware of.</p>
                <p><b>Upcoming Events:</b></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Goldman Sachs Breakfast<br />

                    Meet with Goldman Sachs reps and learn about what it is they do.</li>

                    Mon. Sept. 13th, 5pm, ACES 2.402<br />
                    We will be discussing future events and probably give away some t-shirts.</li>

                    Thur. Sept. 16th, 6pm, PAI 3.14<br />
                    A representative from Lockheed Martin will be giving you tips on how to stand out from the crowd and impress recruiters at the upcoming CNS career fair + free food and probably some more Lockheed swag.  Especially recommended for freshmen.</li>
                    <li>New Member Event: Bowling at the Union<br />
                    Thur. Sept. 16th, following Lockheed's event (~7:30-8pm), Texas Union Underground<br />
                    We especially want to get to know our freshmen and transfer students, but we really want everyone to meet everyone.  So new and returning members alike, come join us for some completely non-academic fun.  Bring some cash -- $1.50 for shoes + $2.50/game -- and your UT ID.  For those of you participating in our iPals mentoring program, this would be a great opportunity to spend time with your mentors/mentees *hint hint*</li>
                    <li>College of Natural Sciences Career Fair<br />
                    Mon. Sept. 20th, 1-6pm, Frank Erwin Center<br />
                    Go find yourself a job or internship.  Dress up in some nice business-y clothes, grab a folder full of resumes, meet some cool recruiters, and, of course, grab some swag.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We'll be having lots more corporate events around the career fair, so keep an eye out for emails with details on those.</p>

			<h2 class="title">Kickoff RSVP form now closed</h2>
			<div class="entry">
                <p>Hey all,</p>
                <p>We have seen an AMAZING response to the announcement of the kickoff.  So amazing, in fact, that we already have more people RSVP'd than we have seats/food for.  If you've already RSVP'd, you should have no problem attending, but PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE let me know if you will not be able to attend, so someone else may attend in your place.  In the meantime, the RSVP form will remain online as a sort of waitlist, but if you have not already RSVP'd, you are not guaranteed a seat at the kickoff and I will email you the day of about if their have been cancellations which allow you to attend.</p>
                <p>I'm truly sorry not everyone will be able to attend, but I am very excited to see you all so enthusiastic.  I think this is going to be a great year if you all continue to show such interest.  We are going to do our best to make sure we have LOTS of awesome events you can attend throughout the year.</p>
                <p>-Amy</p>
